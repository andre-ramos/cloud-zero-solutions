# Solution Details
# >>> STEP 1 - General rules for the TAG:ENVIRONMENT data
# 1 - Transform and lower TAG:ENVIRONMENT data evaluating against the 5 environments the customer wants to standardize on so that I can fix the case sensitive problem, following the order: Disaster Recovery, Production, Staging, Development, and Integration 
# 2 - For each enviroment, I handle the abbreviations using the Contains comparison. Premises based on data observation* go as follows: 
#           a) Enviroment that contains 'dr' will be Disaster Recovery
#           b) Enviroment that contains 'prod' will be Production
#           c) Enviroment that contains 'stg' or 'stag' will be Staging
#           d) Enviroment that contains 'test' or 'dev' will be Development
#           e) Enviroment that contains 'ci' will be Integration 
#         
# >>> STEP 2 - Looking on ACCOUNT_NAME and then RESOURCE collumn for the environment info
#  - I used the same rules as above to fill the empty values, using AND operator
#
# >>> STEP 3 - Filling out the remaining data with the dimension element called “Shared” and handling different values.
# 1 - I found 'prod-stg-ci' as a resource value and it makes sense to be a Shared enviroment in my view
# 2 - 'Any resources in the legacy Acme account that can’t be associated with an environment should be given a dimension element called “Shared”' ->> Anything that have 'Acme' account as value but does not have the TAG:ENVIRONMENT value
# 3 - I couldn't find a proper environment for the 'acme-it' account, so I suppose it's a legacy account, then same rule as above
# 4 - Some values for  TAG:ENVIRONMENT do not contain any info related to their environment so I mapped them manually by its account name.
#         India, release-master-a, release-master-b, infra-teams-ami, infra-il -> Staging
#         central -> Development
#         none, pr-8888 -> Integration 
#
# Data observation points: 
#       -  Since I did not find any space character on TAG:ENVIRONMENT I won't be using transform normalize, furthermore, using Transform with Contains covers all the scenarios where special characters are used
#       -  I assume test is a Development environment
#       -  For empty values I saw no specification on the doc so I chose to follow the general rules for yaml: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34089496/empty-field-in-yaml)
#       -  production-dr means I can't validate production first otherwise dr will be prodution, that's why Disaster Recovery comes first on evaluation
